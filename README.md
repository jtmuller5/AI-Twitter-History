# <a name="intro"></a>🤖 AI Hype: A Twitter History
Since AI exploded onto the scene in late 2022, Twitter has been at the cutting edge of the hype. 
AI news spreads like wildfire on Twitter making it a great place to track new developments, products, and trends.

Unfortunately, every hot new AI thing brings with it a crowd of AI influencers peddling some message about what that thing
means for society. Some messages are informative. Some are pushing a narrative. Others are pure clickbait.

In this repo, I want to zoom out a bit and present the history of AI Twitter in way that
highlights:
- How ridiculous some of it is
- How repetitive some of it is
- How accurate some of it is

I'm also hoping I can shine some light on when certain events occurred and just how close together those events are.
